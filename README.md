Recommended by the Modpack Updater mod, I've put together a modpack updater for The Many Skies modpack I'm working on!

A couple things to note, the release times are done in Unix time, and release [987654321098765] is used for "TBD".

Notes to self: Versions are labeled as a.b.c where:
- a indicates the complete modpack being changed entirely to include new aspects discovered under the Many Skies (i.e. adding Cobblemon to the modpack)
- b indicates moderate changes to the modpack, where the changes are big but subtle (i.e. adding a new world generation mod)
- c indicates smaller QoL changes, features, and bug fixes in between patches (i.e. removing a mod due to it interfering with regular play. or adding a mod bc it seemed like a good idea)

Really up to vibes on how to divide it, just setting the basis for future selves to build off of.
